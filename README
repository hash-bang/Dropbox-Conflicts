NAME
    dbc - Find all Dropbox conflict files within a directory and handle them
    intelligently

SYNOPSIS
            dbc [options]

            This program locates all files labeled as conflicting by Dropbox and tries to apply intelligent rules to handle them.
            If the files conflict in a way that cannot be resolved the user is shown a diff and asked to fix the changes.

OPTIONS
    --dp
    --diffpreview
            Specify the method used when showing the file diffs.

            Valid methods; * Auto - Will run though the below in order and
            use the first valid method * Diff - Use the standard 'diff'
            program

            Variables used in the command can be:

            $base
                The basic file name (and potencial perfect original file) to
                merge all conflicts into.

            $peer
                The conflict file of the found Dropbox base file.

    -d
    --delete
            Delete all conflict files (assumes the user has already done a
            scan with '-l' first).

    --exclude
    -x      Exclude a particular file or directory from the scan.

            This is mainly usedx to exclude Dropbox meta files like
            .dropbox.cache

    --force
    -f      Force attempting to deal with nested conflicts. Should a file
            contain multiple levels of conlict, dbc will not attempt
            to merge the file unless this flag is specified.

    -l
    --list  Display a list of conflicted files but do nothing. Implies '-n'.

    -t
    --temp  Specify a list of temp files to delete silently during the
            scanning process.

    -v
    --verbose
            Be more verbose when outputting information to STDERR. Specify
            multiple times to increase verbosity.

DESCRIPTION
    A command line tool for the manipulation of Dropbox conflict files.

EXAMPLES
    dbconflicts -l
        List all conflicted files in this directory.

TODO
            * Detect if file content is binary
            * Support GUI merging

BUGS
    Quite probably.
